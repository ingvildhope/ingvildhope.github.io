            Line chart demonstrating some accessibility features of Highcharts. The chart displays 
            the most commonly used screen readers in surveys taken by WebAIM from December 2010 to 
            September 2019. JAWS was the most used screen reader until 2019, when NVDA took over. 
            VoiceOver is the third most used screen reader, followed by Narrator. ZoomText/Fusion 
            had a surge in 2015, but usage is otherwise low. The overall use of other screen readers 
            has declined drastically the past few years.
